# Payment Gateways Rank

There are many payment gateways in the market, but not all of them are easy to use, some of the gateways has a lot of constraint on cash your money.
In order to help companies, especially startups to get the best options of payment gateways, here is the list:

1. Stripe

    Stripe so far is the best way for US business payment, although it does support interenational, but less branch compare with PayPal.

2. PayPal

    PayPal so far still the #1 online payment gateway in the market. With large networks support, PayPal could help you on international busines growth.
Even though, it might not friendly to the business owner.

3. Lightspeed

   Serious, Lightspeed is actual POS company and it acuiared Ecwid with 500M in 2021, so far it has $250M revenue; however, its rule is pretty strict.
It still holding some of my fund in the account :( I have to submit several document for approval, not frinedly to the new business owner.

## Summary

I saw that most B2B company is actually using TT transfer, which is simple and easy; however, for self hosted business owner, might would like to find a 
friendy payment. The reason I setup lightspeed is just it aquired Ecwid, I thought it might bring a friendly payment experience; however, in reality, 
unfortuantly, it is kind slightly hard to process.
